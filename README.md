Purpose:
•	To create a backendless artist page for my dad, who is an artist as hobby.
Needs it fulfils:
•	Ability for users to view his artwork and to contact him, by using a htmlform and abilities to contact him on whatsapp, e-mail, instagram and facebook,(as there is no backend, the contactform is just a styled html form.).

Functionality:
Needs to have a responsive design on mobile first design. This has been accomplished using Bootstrap.
User Interface (UI) and (UX):
The website has different user interfaces dependent on screen size. There is a mobile and a desktop version of the website. The differences are that the desktop version has a different heading image and that the midsection has 3 columns with two thumbnails per column, whereas the mobile version has one column with 6 thumbnails. I have done that to provide a better user experience. Each thumbnail represents a different page, where paintings are viewable. Also on the thumbnail pages there is a difference between the desktop and the mobile website. The desktop website has on every page all paintings displayed, one big and the rest small. By hovering on the small picture the picture will be displayed in big. The mobile version has a click carousel. The reason is that on a mobile the screen would be too small by displaying all the pictures on one page. 

Technologies used:
•	Javascript - For form submission and the scroll down and scroll up functionality.
•	JQuery – for sliders and the navbar. 
•	Bootstrap 3 – used to build up the whole grid.
•	CSS Flexbox. Is used to align the footer. 
•	Bootsnipp and codepen used, for the navbar(bootsnipp.com) and the textsliders(codepen.com)
•	W3 Javascript - Used for creating an infinite loop to cycle hue.
•	W3 Include HTML - Used to create a standard navbar section.
•	Font Awesome - Used for some icons.
•	Github and Github Pages - Used to track the progress of the project, and host the site for submission without a backend.
•	Hover CSS effects. 
•	HTML5
•	CSS3
•	Cloud 9 - Used to code the project.
Deployment method: Github Pages

•	Has an up and down scroll bottun.  
•	Has hover effects over pictures and navbarlogo and the footer. 
Paarden.html

•	Carousel cycles pictures automatically or when users click the appropriate arrows. A compromise had to be made with the size of the carousel due to the varying image dimensions.

Honden.html
•	Is used to show artwork about dogs.
•	Carousel cycles pictures automatically or when users click the appropriate arrows. A compromise had to be made with the size of the carousel due to the varying image dimensions.
Portret.html
•	Is used to show artwork about human portraits. 
•	Carousel cycles pictures automatically or when users click the appropriate arrows. A compromise had to be made with the size of the carousel due to the varying image dimensions.

•	Carousel cycles pictures automatically or when users click the appropriate arrows. A compromise had to be made with the size of the carousel due to the varying image dimensions.


 
Requirements:
•	Create a website of around 4-5 pages.
•	Incorporate main navigation and grid layout.
•	Include at least one form with validation. Since you are not expected to build a backend for the project, all this form needs to do is inform the user of whether or not the data was submitted successfully (i.e. passed validation)
•	Whenever possible, strive to use semantic HTML5 elements to better structure your HTML code.
•	Make sure your site is as responsive as possible. You can test this by checking the site on different screen sizes and browsers.
•	The site should contain your own custom JavaScript logic – include at least one interactive component on your site that is based on non-trivial javascript logic. You can write this logic either inside an Angular controller/service, or in a separate js file.
•	You should conduct and document tests to ensure that all of you websites functionality works well. Automated testing using frameworks such as Jasmine are preferable, but properly documented manual tests are also acceptable.
•	Write a README.md file for your project (in Markdown format) that explains what the project does and the need that it fulfils. It should also describe the functionality of the project, as well as the technologies used. Detail how the project was deployed and tested and if some of the work was based off other code, explain what was kept and/or how it was changed to fit your need. A project submitted without a README.md file will FAIL.
•	In addition to the README.md file, you may include in your repository supplementary documentation and/or other relevant supporting material for the assessor in any format that is automatically handled by web browsers, such as html, pdf, jpg, etc. Files in proprietary formats such as Microsoft doc/docx will be ignored; but this is generally not a hindrance, since the vast majority of formats can be easily exported to PDF.
•	Use Git & GitHub for version control. Each new piece of functionality should be in a separate commit.
•	Deploy the final version of your code to a hosting platform such as GitHub Pages.
